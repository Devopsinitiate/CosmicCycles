        <p class="text-lg text-purple-200 mb-4">
            This web application is a tool designed to help you understand and navigate the various cyclical influences in your life. It is based on the principles outlined in the book "Self-Mastery and Fate with the Cycles of Life" by H. Spencer Lewis, a profound work that explores the hidden rhythms of the universe and their effect on our lives.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-purple-200 mb-4">
            The core idea is that everything in the universe, from the smallest atom to the largest galaxy, operates in cycles. By understanding these cycles, we can work in harmony with them to achieve greater success, happiness, and self-mastery.

        <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Cycles of Life</h2>
        <p class="text-lg text-purple-200 mb-4">
            The application calculates and displays several key cycles, each with its own unique characteristics and influences:
        </p>

        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg text-purple-300 space-y-4">
            <li>
                <strong>The Daily Cycle:</strong> This cycle is divided into seven periods, each lasting approximately 3 hours and 25 minutes. It governs the subtle energies of the day and can be used to determine the most propitious times for various activities.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The Yearly Cycle:</strong> This cycle begins on your birthday and is divided into seven periods of approximately 52 days each. It reveals the major themes and influences you will encounter throughout the year.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The Human Life Cycle:</strong> This is a larger cycle that divides our lives into seven-year periods, each with its own developmental focus.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The Business Cycle:</strong> Similar to the yearly cycle, but applied to the start date of a business or a major project.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>The Soul Cycle:</strong> This cycle is based on the solar year and reveals the deeper, soul-level influences at play in our lives.
            </li>
        </ul>
